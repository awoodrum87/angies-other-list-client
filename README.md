# Angie's Other List Client Documentation
Angie's Other List is a spoof of Angie's List, a review website for service providers.
Angie's Other List allows employees to review their customers! The tables have turned! Bad tippers
and rude customers are about to be exposed to the world!

My final product looks much different because I decided to incorporate modals into my UI.

# Client side achievements I'm proud of
• Wrote a function to prevent future dates from being picked in the HTML datepicker
• Incorporated some bootstrap elements
• Error handling for blocking a review from being written without first being a reviewer.
  This wasn't particularly difficult, but the I had a 'break through' in my problem solving approach:

# Client side opportunities to improve
• Make application responsive using bootstrap
• Rendered List of reviews - clean up and make more visually appealing.
