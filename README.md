# Client side achievements I'm proud of
- Wrote a function to prevent future dates from being picked in the HTML datepicker
- Incorporated some bootstrap elements
- Error handling for blocking a review from being written without first being a reviewer and custom error messages based on the error - required accessing parts of the error object and determining how to use it to generate certain error modals
- [my problem solving approach](https://goo.gl/photos/CKKZtKAqCFqeyavw6) was to write out the problem, ID what I know, what information I have available (example: an error object or JSON response), and what I need to know. 

# Client side opportunities to improve
- Make application responsive using bootstrap
- Rendered List of reviews - clean up and make more visually appealing
- Make handlebars responsive so it updates as updates and deletions are made
